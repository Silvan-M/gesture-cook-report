As part of my school's PU (Deu: Projektunterricht) curriculum, I developed an app called GestureCook. This app enables users to browse through recipes without the need to touch their phones, reducing the risk of bacterial contamination during cooking.

This repository serves as documentation detailing the process of creating this project.
